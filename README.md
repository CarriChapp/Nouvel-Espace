# Nouvel-Espace
Information regarding the running of the game and game play can be found in this file. This game should run on either Linux or Windows, but I prefer Linux an so the instructions below are for Linux. 
<p><b>Running the Game</b><br>
To run the game, first download the zip file of the source code and extract it to a suitable location on your system. Hopefully this will be something like <i>~/nouvel-espace</i>. You will also require python3.</p>
<p>Next open a terminal and navigate to your extract directory, then simply type:<p>
<p><i>python3 main.py</i></p>
<p><b>Game Play</b><br>
Playing the game is simple. To move around the map, you can enter one of the main compass points <i>(north,east,south,west)</i> to attempt to move in that direction, the game will let you know if you can't!</p>
<p>To interact with the environment, you can take objects that happen to be around you. To do so simply type <i>take object_name</i>. You can also see what you have in your inventory, type <i>inventory</i>.</p>  
<p>You can also save your progress by typing <i>save</i> and load a saved game by typing <i>load</i>. The rest you can discover for yourself...</p>
